# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-Logic-Gates

There have been many software implementations of Tic-Tac-Toe.
There have been a few hardware implementations on breadboard but none of them is where it was converted to PCB (Printed Circuit Board).
For this project, I am using KiCAD software. It is a open source software. I did an online course on Udemy 'Introduction to KiCAD' by Javier Martinez.
